He is the former photo editor at The Caravan magazine. Srinivas’ work has evolved over 20 years, shifting between the personal and the political. While his early work revolved around his community of friends and activism in New York and London, his current documentary practice focuses on environmental issues. Srinivas’ has done photography series that documents the daily lives of manual laborers, from the ship-breaking yards of Bombay to the coal mining villages of Dhanbad. Since 2001, his work has been extensively themed on the impact of HIV/AIDS on the living and working conditions of the patients. He began photographing patients and staff at the Freedom Foundation HIV/AIDS clinics in Bangalore and Hyderabad. This effort evolved into a collaboration- the Lives in Focus Project, which documents through interviews, photographs and video, the impact of India's new patent law on the country's HIV positive population. Srinivas is also working on a long-term project on industrial and environmental pollution in India.
