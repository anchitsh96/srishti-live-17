His works often examine techniques of moving image production and presentation in relation to their form and perception. Loops, found footage and their disclosure have become integral parts of his work. His idea of experimentation includes the act of perception through the spectator.  His travels to Mumbai have had a strong impact on his work, which often looks into the aesthetics of popular Indian cinema and television within the urban context. In his films and expanded cinema works, Bernd has been using all available formats, from digital video through small gauge formats like Super-8 and 16mm to 35mm film. He is an active member of Labor Berlin, an artist-run film lab that provides equipment and facilities to enable its members to process, copy and edit their own films. In 2003, he studied Fine Arts and Media Art at the University of the Arts Berlin, where he completed Maria Vedder's master class. Berndâ€™s films have been shown at museums, exhibitions and film festivals worldwide, including Centre Pompidou, Berlinale International Film Festival, Rotterdam, San Francisco Cinematheque and at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale in India.
